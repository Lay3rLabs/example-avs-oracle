# AVS Oracle Example

This is a simple, yet realistic, example of an AVS built on Layer, which shows the power of WASI
to do something beyond simple squaring (which can be done in a contract).

It also provides an example how you can customize and use the WASI APIs
to make HTTP requests and access files in your component. It also provides and example of
how to customize the verifier contract when you want do have a more complex "reduce function"
than exact matches above a threshold.
